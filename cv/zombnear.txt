>>>>> The following information is only for BETA TESTING <<<<<

The game includes a programmer's key.

Before main title screen appears, press right button of
controller 1 plus one of the following keys:

  7  -  Shows all 64x64 portraits. Press reset after
  8  -  Shows all images with intro. Press reset after
  1  -  Activate debugging (the screen will remain black until
        you depress the key). Now inside the game, press key
        from controller 1:

        2 - Reloads energy.
        3 - Gets key.
        7 - Goes to next map, it doesn't change music.
        9 - Goes to next floor, it has bugs when getting
            out from boss' room, and it can "hang" if player
            gets blocked. It was only used to check right
            compression of rooms.
        5 - Victory, goes without story to final sequence.
            (simple for one player, romantic for two players).
